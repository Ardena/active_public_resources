The sequel to Smash TV's critically acclaimed \"Skinemax\", Memorex is a 50 minute VJ odyssey, a tribute to an entire generation who grew up with only a TV and a VCR for a babysitter.\n\nSourced from over forty hours of 80s commercials pulled from warped VHS tapes, Memorex is a deep exploration of nostalgia and the cultural values of an era of excess. It's a re-contextualization of ads - cultural detritus, the lowest of the low - into something altogether more profound, humorous, and at times, even beautiful.\n\n\nDigging up long forgotten memories for a generation who spent their formative years glued to the boob tube, Memorex is a veritable nostalgia nuke for children of the 80s. Endless beach parties, Saturday morning cartoons, claymation everything, sleek cars, sexy babes, toys you forgot existed, station idents, primitive computer animation, all your favorite sugary cereal mascots, and so much more. An ode to the hyper consumerism and sleek veneer of a simpler time.\n\n\nThe audio provides a perfect accompaniment to the warped and weirdly nostalgic footage, like finding your favorite cassette from childhood after it\u2019s been baking in the sun for 25 years. An authentic audio\/visual package, Memorex was designed to look and feel like the real deal. The ultimate VHS tape.\n\n\n\nIs it a lost cultural relic, melted to the dash of an '83 Nissan Sentra?\n\nIs it a sinister government experiment, designed to brainwash children into becoming consumer slaves?\n\nIs it the pinnacle of blipverts, sent back in time from 20 minutes into the future? \n\nIs it the holy grail of unlabeled VHS tapes, tucked away in the back room of an abandoned Blockbuster?\n\nIs it live, or is it Memorex?\n\n\nWe didn't create your childhood, we just organized it for you. How to brainwash an entire generation. \nOBEY. CONSUME. THIS IS YOUR GOD.\n\n\nThis video is protected under fair use copyright law.

High School (Documentary Preview)","description":"In sixty short years, South Korea went from being one of the poorest countries in Asia to having the world's 13th largest economy. Korean students have some of the highest test scores in the world, and a higher rate of acceptance into American Ivy Leagues than any other foreign country. But Korea also leads the world in two not quite so stunning ways- the highest rate of plastic surgery per capita, and a higher suicide rate than any other developed nation.\n\nSo. What's life like for a Korean student? In one of the most competitive societies in the world, how does one find their place? What does it take to achieve your aspirations and goals? Our documentary will take a look at the lives of five Korean teenagers on the verge of either reaching- or losing- their dreams. The film will follow the students during the most stressful time of their lives- their last year of high school. After studying for roughly sixteen hours each day, their futures boil down to one last exam. On November 10th, 2011, thousands of high school seniors will take a nine hour test that for many, will determine their economic and social status for the rest of their lives.","upload_date":"2011-07-24 12:38:46","modified_date":"2013-11-20 14:27:42","number_of_plays":"387937","number_of_likes":"940","number_of_comments":"76","width":"640","height":"360","duration":"1127","owner":{"display_name":"Kelley Katzenmeyer","id":"5914135","is_plus":"1","is_pro":"0","is_staff":"0","profileurl":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/user5914135","realname":"Kelley Katzenmeyer","username":"user5914135","videosurl":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/user5914135\/videos","portraits":{"portrait":[{"height":"30","width":"30","_content":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6d1b5c1b43a42ac92aca416849ed81be?d=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fimages_v6%2Fportraits%2Fportrait_30_blue.png&s=30"},{"height":"75","width":"75","_content":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6d1b5c1b43a42ac92aca416849ed81be?d=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fimages_v6%2Fportraits%2Fportrait_75_blue.png&s=75"},{"height":"100","width":"100","_content":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6d1b5c1b43a42ac92aca416849ed81be?d=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fimages_v6%2Fportraits%2Fportrait_100_blue.png&s=100"},{"height":"300","width":"300","_content":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6d1b5c1b43a42ac92aca416849ed81be?d=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fimages_v6%2Fportraits%2Fportrait_300_blue.png&s=300"}]}},"tags":{"tag":[{"author":"5914135","id":"60172933","normalized":"korea","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:korea","_content":"korea"},{"author":"5914135","id":"60172934","normalized":"korean","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:korean","_content":"korean"},{"author":"5914135","id":"60172935","normalized":"highschool","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:high+school","_content":"high school"},{"author":"5914135","id":"60172936","normalized":"education","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:education","_content":"education"},{"author":"5914135","id":"60172937","normalized":"plasticsurgery","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:plastic+surgery","_content":"plastic surgery"},{"author":"5914135","id":"60172938","normalized":"cosmeticsurgery","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:cosmetic+surgery","_content":"cosmetic surgery"},{"author":"5914135","id":"60172939","normalized":"kelleykatzenmeyer","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:kelley+katzenmeyer","_content":"kelley katzenmeyer"},{"author":"5914135","id":"60173506","normalized":"suicide","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:suicide","_content":"suicide"}]},"cast":{"member":{"display_name":"Kelley Katzenmeyer","id":"5914135","role":"","username":"user5914135"}},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"video","_content":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/26833191"},{"type":"mobile","_content":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/m\/26833191"}]},"thumbnails":{"thumbnail":[{"height":"75","width":"100","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/177\/586\/177586516_100.jpg"},{"height":"150","width":"200","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/177\/586\/177586516_200.jpg"},{"height":"360","width":"640","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/177\/586\/177586516_640.jpg"}]}},{"allow_adds":"1","embed_privacy":"anywhere","id":"39048998","is_hd":"1","is_transcoding":"0","license":"0","privacy":"anybody","title":"Welcome to the Anthropocene","description":"In June 2012, \"Welcome to the Anthropocene\"\u2014a film about the state of the planet\u2014opened the UN's Rio+20 summit on sustainable development.

 With the Warwick Rowers 2014 calendar, you will be able to get exactly the kind of perspective you need on the year ahead.  \n\nFeaturing genuine university athletes who have stripped off to brighten up your each and every day, our calendar guarantees a very enjoyable 2014 for everyone who buys it, with a strong possibility of a welcome surprise around the start of each month.  We're also sensing that there could be passion on the horizon, because if this calendar doesn't get you going, nothing will!\n\nAnd this calendar won't just be good news for you.  As well as helping the students with their sport, it's raising funds and awareness to support Sport Allies, a new programme developed by the rowers themselves in partnership with a registered charity, Educational Action Challenging Homophobia. (EACH, UK Reg Charity No. 1095665).\n\nSport Allies is dedicated to challenging homophobia among young people.  The rowers are predominantly straight men who have welcomed and embraced the fantastic support they have had from the gay community for their fundraising efforts.  Sport Allies is their way of honoring that support and giving something back.  The rowers will share with young people their own experience of learning to understand the challenges that others face, simply on the grounds of their sexuality, and how this has changed these athletes both as individuals and as a team.\n\nSo please support the rowers and their efforts by visiting WarwickRowers.org, where you will be able to purchase calendars, greeting cards, films, and digital downloads.  It's the hottest way to help...\n\nTwitter:  @naked_rowers  \n\nFacebook:  http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Warwick-Rowings-Mens-Naked-Calendar\/496964983654487?ref=ts&fref=ts","upload_date":"2013-10-21 10:56:01","modified_date":"2013-11-20 14:44:39","number_of_plays":"1059257","number_of_likes":"613","number_of_comments":"9","width":"1920","height":"1080","duration":"114","owner":{"display_name":"Progressive Media","id":"5362000","is_plus":"1","is_pro":"0","is_staff":"0","profileurl":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/progressivemedia","realname":"Progressive Media","username":"progressivemedia","videosurl":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/progressivemedia\/videos","portraits":{"portrait":[{"height":"30","width":"30","_content":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/dfab8841dfce2a7d82b1acf2177088c9?d=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fimages_v6%2Fportraits%2Fportrait_30_blue.png&s=30"},{"height":"75","width":"75","_content":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/dfab8841dfce2a7d82b1acf2177088c9?d=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fimages_v6%2Fportraits%2Fportrait_75_blue.png&s=75"},{"height":"100","width":"100","_content":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/dfab8841dfce2a7d82b1acf2177088c9?d=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fimages_v6%2Fportraits%2Fportrait_100_blue.png&s=100"},{"height":"300","width":"300","_content":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/dfab8841dfce2a7d82b1acf2177088c9?d=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fimages_v6%2Fportraits%2Fportrait_300_blue.png&s=300"}]}},"tags":{"tag":[{"author":"5362000","id":"134783015","normalized":"rowers","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:rowers","_content":"rowers"},{"author":"5362000","id":"134783016","normalized":"naked","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:naked","_content":"naked"},{"author":"5362000","id":"134783017","normalized":"nude","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:nude","_content":"nude"},{"author":"5362000","id":"134783018","normalized":"athletes","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:athletes","_content":"athletes"},{"author":"5362000","id":"134783019","normalized":"university","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:university","_content":"university"},{"author":"5362000","id":"134783020","normalized":"charity","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:charity","_content":"charity"},{"author":"5362000","id":"134783021","normalized":"homophobia","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:homophobia","_content":"homophobia"},{"author":"5362000","id":"134783022","normalized":"nudity","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:nudity","_content":"nudity"},{"author":"5362000","id":"134783023","normalized":"rowing","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:rowing","_content":"rowing"},{"author":"5362000","id":"134783024","normalized":"calendar","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:calendar","_content":"calendar"},{"author":"5362000","id":"134783025","normalized":"nakedcalendar","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:naked+calendar","_content":"naked calendar"}]},"cast":{"member":{"display_name":"Progressive Media","id":"5362000","role":"","username":"progressivemedia"}},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"video","_content":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/77412748"},{"type":"mobile","_content":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/m\/77412748"}]},"thumbnails":{"thumbnail":[{"height":"75","width":"100","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/452\/583\/452583407_100.jpg"},{"height":"150","width":"200","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/452\/583\/452583407_200.jpg"},{"height":"360","width":"640","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/452\/583\/452583407_640.jpg"}]}},{"allow_adds":"1","embed_privacy":"anywhere","id":"3658572","is_hd":"0","is_transcoding":"0","license":"0","privacy":"anybody","title":"A War For Your Soul-Birmingham version","description":"Filmmaker and public speaker Reggie Bullock is one of the most sought after motivational speakers in the United States, traveling to over 60 cities in the past two years.  \n\nReggie\u2019s short film \"A War For Your Soul\" is a stirring,   inspirational video for today\u2019s generation. Over 10 million internet viewers have watched \u201cA War For Your Soul\u201d in 2 years. The video has garnered praise from mayors, city leaders, youth and civic organizations and almost every major country around the world, sparking dialogue in encouraging adults to play a more active role in educating children. \n\nOn Oct. 14th, Popular radio host Michael Baisden said \"This is a must see film\".\n\nReggie has received the \"key to the city\" award from the cities of Macon GA., Riviera Beach Fl. and Corpus Christi TX.\n\nReggie is currently active as a noted speaker, conducting speaking engagements throughout the country. For speaking engagements contact www.warforyoursoul.com  or reggie.bullock@warforyoursoul.com \n\nThis video was created to inspire young at-risk African-Americans not to fall prey to some of the problems they face in society. The \"Master of Darkness\" represents that abstract concept of evil that has the potential to reside in the consciousness of mankind.\n\nThe use of the images of Richard Pryor and NAS, were used to show how we have publicly displayed the \"N\" word over the course of time. Richard Pryor, before his death, had gone on record to publicly denounce his use of the word, and the Rapper NAS ( one of the few socially conscious rappers ) intentions of wearing the jacket had nothing to do with the glorification of the word. I have enjoyed some of Pryor's masterful story telling and I have also enjoyed some of the thought provoking music from NAS.\n\n This video should not to be used to divide people (Black & White). \nThis video should not be used to criticize all aspects of hip-hop culture.\nThis video should not be used to allow the rest of society to escape from their responsibility, to help with financial & academic support.  \n\nIf used properly, this video will allow our youth to see some of the horrific conditions that their ancestors fought through and some of the horrific conditions they face today.\n\nAn extensive commentary about the film can be seen at www.warforyoursoul.com\n\n **THIS VIDEO IS NOT FOR SALE & I AM NOT ACCEPTING DONATIONS FOR THE FILM, I ONLY WANT THE MESSAGE TO REACH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ANY HIDDEN POLITICAL OR FINANCIAL AGENDA.\n\nSpeaking Engagements for Reggie Bullock 2009 - 2011: \n\n2009\nApr 19 Florida African American Student Association, Orlando Fl. \n\nSep 23 Central Ct.

Purity Myth Trailer","description":"Produced & Distributed by the Media Education Foundation\nFeaturing Jessica Valenti\n\nIn this video adaptation of her bestselling book, pioneering feminist blogger Jessica Valenti trains her sights on \"the virginity movement\" -- an unholy alliance of evangelical Christians, right-wing politicians, and conservative policy intellectuals who have been exploiting irrational fears about women's sexuality to roll back women's rights. From dad-and-daughter \"purity balls,\" taxpayer-funded abstinence-only curricula, and political attacks on Planned Parenthood, to recent attempts by legislators to de-fund women's reproductive health care and narrow the legal definition of rape, Valenti identifies a single, unifying assumption: the myth that the worth of a woman depends on what she does -- or does not do -- sexually. In the end, Valenti argues that the health and well-being of women are too important to be left to ideologues bent on vilifying feminism and undermining women's autonomy.","upload_date":"2011-12-05 14:12:15","modified_date":"2013-11-20 14:12:29","number_of_likes":"421","number_of_comments":"8","width":"1280","height":"720","duration":"217","owner":{"display_name":"Media Education Foundation","id":"4792389","is_plus":"1","is_pro":"0","is_staff":"0","profileurl":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/user4792389","realname":"Media Education Foundation","username":"user4792389","videosurl":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/user4792389\/videos","portraits":{"portrait":[{"height":"30","width":"30","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/132\/188\/1321883_30.jpg"},{"height":"75","width":"75","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/132\/188\/1321883_75.jpg"},{"height":"100","width":"100","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/132\/188\/1321883_100.jpg"},{"height":"300","width":"300","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/132\/188\/1321883_300.jpg"}]}},"tags":{"tag":[{"author":"4792389","id":"72641833","normalized":"women","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:women","_content":"women"},{"author":"4792389","id":"72641834","normalized":"girls","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:girls","_content":"girls"},{"author":"4792389","id":"72641835","normalized":"abstinence","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:abstinence","_content":"abstinence"},{"author":"4792389","id":"72641836","normalized":"purityballs","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:purity+balls","_content":"purity balls"},{"author":"4792389","id":"72641837","normalized":"jessicavalenti","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:Jessica+Valenti","_content":"Jessica Valenti"},{"author":"4792389","id":"72641838","normalized":"contraception","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:contraception","_content":"contraception"},{"author":"4792389","id":"72641839","normalized":"planb","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:Plan+B","_content":"Plan B"},{"author":"4792389","id":"72641840","normalized":"sexuality","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:sexuality","_content":"sexuality"},{"author":"4792389","id":"72641841","normalized":"rape","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:rape","_content":"rape"},{"author":"4792389","id":"72641842","normalized":"reprodutivehealth","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/tag:reprodutive+health","_content":"reprodutive health"}]},"cast":{"member":{"display_name":"Media Education Foundation","id":"4792389","role":"","username":"user4792389"}},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"video","_content":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/33173853"},{"type":"mobile","_content":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/m\/33173853"}]},"thumbnails":{"thumbnail":[{"height":"75","width":"100","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/224\/965\/224965973_100.jpg"},{"height":"150","width":"200","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/224\/965\/224965973_200.jpg"},{"height":"360","width":"640","_content":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/224\/965\/224965973_640.jpg"}]}},{"allow_adds":"1","embed_privacy":"anywhere","id":"11222689","is_hd":"1","is_transcoding":"0","license":"0","privacy":"anybody","title":"Every 15 Minutes: Castro Valley High School (High Definition)","description":"UPDATE 2013: We're proud to say we've just created a new Every 15 Minutes movie for San Leandro High School. You can view it here: http:\/\/youtu.be\/pUzo66LEC5c\n\nUPDATE April 2012: We're proud to show off our newest Every 15 Minutes movie. It's a sequel of sorts to this award winning video. \n\nEvery 15 Minutes: Castro Valley High School 2012 \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/24LdA8apNEs\n\nThere's also a video we're proud of we recently did at Livermore in 2012. Here's that video: http:\/\/youtu.be\/q2VagFbsuQY\n\nORIGINAL: We are very proud of this video. Yes, we love it, which is why we're doubly happy it was awarded a 2011 Emmy for achievement in Informational\/Instructional Programming. \n\nIt is the Every 15 Minutes: Castro Valley High School, 2010. Like our other videos in this line, it was produced to help persuade students in high school not to drink and drive. \n\nIn April 2011, we made a sequel of sorts: Every 15 Minutes: San Leandro High School 2011. We used some of the techniques we used here, as well as a few new tricks. Here's the broadcast version of that video: \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/pT_ssbVwP7o\n\nHere's the original version of the video, which runs a little longer: \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/aa92QyfauvY\n\nAs an example of our earlier work, and one of the videos that got help us gain a reputation as one of the best Every 15 Minutes video producers in the country, here's Every 15 Minutes: Concord High School 2007:\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/tnHY4-DlNz8\n\nIn the Concord program, you can see some of the innovations we brought to the format, which have since been used by various video teams across the country. \n\nNow a little deep background. The Every 15 Minutes program is a drunk driving education program for high school junior and seniors. This is an example of www.RocketSpots.tv 's level of quality in the area of community service video production.\n\nIn October 2010, this Castro Valley video was nominated for an Every 15 Minutes Award in 2010 by the National Every 15 Minutes Organization. We're also very proud to say it's the most viewed Every 15 Minutes movie\/video of all time. \n\nOn June 11, 2011, Christopher Allan Smith and Ryan Neisz won an Emmy for this presentation of the Every 15 Minutes: Castro Valley High School 2010 program. The award was for Excellence in Informational Programming. \n\nWe'd like to thank everyone involved in this program, and dedicate the Emmy to everyone who worked so hard on this amazing program.\n\nIf you'd like, come over to  www.Rocketspots.tv to learn more about our work with the Every 15 Minutes program.

He trained as an actor and director in New York with Salem Ludwig and with Donna DeMatteo for playwriting. For Mani, the decision to work in the film industry guided his academic decisions from an early age. He attended a Toronto high school renowned for excellence in the arts, and was accepted into one of the highly competitive film program at Ryerson university. It is notable that he went to Ryerson with an already well-established career in theatre, film, television and commercial work, and a range of multi-faceted achievements including producing, cinematography, casting, writing, directing, acting, and editing. On his own he added stints in New York and Los Angeles with leading acting teachers, as well as learning the grace and style of many forms of dance and athletics. With courses perceptively, he has also recognized the importance of acquiring an understanding of the business side of the industry, and the varied aspects of technology and production. There are some people clearly born to follow the path they have chosen from the start. Mani Nasry has the passion to succeed, the curiosity and ingenuity required to lead and collaborate in an industry known for its impact and appeal, and the strength of character and work ethic to immerse himself in finding and telling an unforgettable story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMANI NASRY FILM AND TELEVISION RESUME Performer Profile Gender: Male Height: 5 feet 7 in Weight: 140 Age Range: 21 - 29 Physique: Athletic Hair Color: Brown Eyes: Brown Film Family Curse (2003 TV movie) Cast-Apr 01, 2003 SHADOW WALKERS PRODUCTIONS LTD Dawn of the Dead (2004) Cast-May 25, 2003\/Jul 20, 2003 CORPUS VIVOS PRODUCTIONS INC Beautiful Girl (2003 TV movie) Cast-Aug 31, 2003 NEVER TIME PRODUCTIONS LTD New York Minute (2004\/I) Cast-Sep 07, 2003 NY MINUTE FILMS INC Prom Queen: The Marc Hall Story (2004 TV movie) Cast-Oct 18, 2003 ADJUSTMENT BULLOCH Childstar (2004) Cast-Nov 23, 2003\/Dec 07, 2003 RHOMBUS MEDIA The Coven (2004 TV movie) Cast-Dec 07, 2003 COVEN PRODUCTIONS CORP Man of the Year (2006) Cast-Feb 14, 2006 AXIUM ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES CANADA HOOKED ON SPEEDMAN Cast-Mar 08, 2006 PLAYING ARMY PRODUCTIONS INC \"WHAT DO YOU SEE 1\" Cast-Mar 14, 2006 ARNOLD WORLDWIDE CANADA Road to Christmas (2006 TV movie) Cast-Apr 02, 2006\/ Apr 23, 2006 LET IT SNOW PRODUCTIONS INC.

and Covered: A Survival Guide to the Post Apocalypse","description":"Ducked and Covered: A Survival Guide to the Post Apocalypse is an instructional public information film designed to assist the general population with surviving life in Australia after a nuclear war. Produced by the Australian Board of Civil Defense during the early 1980s, this previously unseen, dusty print was uncovered deep within a university film archive. \nBroken into four chapters, the film guides wary survivors through the trials that will await them in the post apocalypse. From post-apocalyptic fashion and unique uses for surplus human skulls, to becoming a local warlord and avoiding radioactive mutants, there is something for all dwellers of the wastelands. With its dry methodical narration, brooding synthesizer, minimalist animation and erroneous guidance, Ducked and Covered is a dark humored parody\/loving homage to the late cold war era, early 1980\u2019s public information films, as well as a reminder\u2026 OF WHAT STILL COULD BE. \n\n\nWINNER - Audience Award - Best Animated Film - MAELSTROM INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL, Seattle, WA, USA
